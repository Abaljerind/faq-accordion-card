## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Jquery](https://api.jquery.com/) - For javascript library

### Continued development

For future development, i got several things below:

- For the images (illustration and the pattern in desktop devices), to be honest, i'm stuck and really stuck at this one, i couldn't change it like the design, so maybe in the future if i can finally know how to do it, i would love to fix it.
- In the javascript code, i would love to make it when the arrow clicked, the answer doesn't take space so the height would be still the same.
- Also in javascript code, i would love to make it when 1 arrow clicked, the other arrow and the answer would close automatically.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this tailwind css and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
- [Jquery](https://api.jquery.com/) - This helped me to code with javascript more less and easy, well i still got a lot to learn and there's no perfect time to do it than right now.
